   following properties are related to css animations
   -> @keyframes
   -> animation-name
   -> animation-duration
   -> animation-delay
   -> animation-iteration-count
   -> animation-direction
   -> animation-timing-function
   -> animation-fill-mode
   -> animation

   css animation is possible only after you specify certain keyframes for the animation
   -> the animation must be binded to an element inorder for it to work.
   (here we are binding it to div element)
