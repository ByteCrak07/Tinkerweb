             The browser fetches the image from the path provided in src attribute.
             Also notice that <img> tag doesnt have a closing tag. Such elements are called void
             elements and cannot have any child elements. Similar is the case with <hr> and <br> tags.-->

          <!-- You can try using a link to an online image inside src attribute -->

          <!-- Notice that the path provided is incorrect (No extension). So no image is shown -->

               <!-- Wasn't the first image too large? This is how we can control its size. 
                 Also notice how the image is within an <a> tag making the image a hyperlink to google-->
